# Cek Khodam: Discover Your Inner Spirit! 🌟

Welcome to the **Cek Khodam** repository! 🎉 Yes, you've stumbled upon the most mystical and completely unofficial website that lets you find out who your khodam (spirit guardian) is just by entering your name. No crystal balls or tarot cards required! 🔮✨

## Why Does This Exist? 🤔

Well, my friend, because who doesn't want to know their inner khodam? I mean, it's not every day you get to unlock the secrets of the universe with just a name! This project was born out of pure curiosity and a sprinkle of silliness—just like a good pancake! 🥞

## Features 🌈

- **Enter Your Name**: Type it in and let the magic happen! 🪄
- **Instant Khodam Reveal**: Watch as your khodam appears like a genie from a bottle (minus the smoke). 💨
